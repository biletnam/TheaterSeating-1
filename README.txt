NOTES:

- This solution should be compatible with the latest Visual Studio Community Edition (free).
- Please use Input.txt for the input data. Simply compile and run to display the output.
- The solutions dependencies is included in the packages.config and should resolve with no issues.
- The project starting point is in Main.cs.
- The project uses NUnit for Unit testing the modules.
- I wrote the code using TDD methodology. 
- I applied SOLID principles as much as I can so that modules can be independent of each other.
- Another advantage is it made it easier for me to unit test and refactor the modules.

Thank you,
Nick Vargas
